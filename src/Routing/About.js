            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>It's not just wishful thinking. It's our noble cause — an idea that drives everything we do.</p>
            <p>When you put your dreams online—your words, your photos, your creations—you shouldn't have to worry about your service provider mining that data for marketing purposes. Those are your dreams — not ours! DreamHost's open platform gives you the power to share your data and the freedom to control how it's used.</p>
